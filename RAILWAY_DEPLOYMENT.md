## Testing Your Deployment

### 1. Check Health Endpoint

Visit: `https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/health`

You should see:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-25T...",
  "uptime": 123.456,
  "environment": "production"
}
```

### 2. Test API Info

Visit: `https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/`

You should see:
```json
{
  "name": "Audico Call System",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "AI-powered call center agent with South African voice",
  "endpoints": {
    "voice": "/voice/*",
    "analytics": "/analytics/*",
    "health": "/health"
  }
}
```

### 3. Make a Test Call

Call your Twilio number: **+1 620 529 1708** (or your local SA number)

Expected flow:
1. "This call will be recorded for quality and training purposes."
2. "Welcome to Audico. How may I assist you today? You may also say menu to hear our department options."
3. Try saying: "I need help with shipping" or "Show me the menu"

## Monitoring & Logs

### View Logs in Real-Time

1. In Railway dashboard, click your service
2. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
3. Click on the latest deployment
4. You'll see live logs from your app

### What to Look For

‚úÖ Good logs:
```
[Server] Configuration validated successfully
================================================
  Audico Call System - AI Voice Agent
================================================
  Server running on port: 3000
  Ready to accept calls!
```

‚ùå Bad logs (configuration errors):
```
[Server] Configuration error: Missing required environment variable: TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
```

If you see errors, go back to **Variables** tab and add the missing variables.

## Cost Estimate

Railway pricing is simple and transparent:

- **Free Trial**: $5 credit (enough for ~1 week of testing)
- **After Trial**: Pay as you go
  - ~$5-10/month for a small call center
  - ~$20-30/month for moderate usage
  - Scales automatically based on usage

### What You Pay For:
- **CPU time** (when processing calls)
- **RAM usage** (~512MB for this app)
- **Network egress** (data transfer)

No per-request charges like other platforms!

## Updating Your Deployment

Every time you push to GitHub, Railway will automatically:
1. Pull the latest code
2. Run `npm install`
3. Restart the server
4. Zero-downtime deployment

To manually trigger a deployment:
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click **"Deploy"** button

---

## Environment-Specific Settings

### Development (Local)
```bash
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
```

### Production (Railway)
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000  # Railway will use this port internally
```

Railway automatically provides `PORT` environment variable, but our app uses 3000 by default.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Configuration error: Missing required environment variable"

**Solution**: Add the missing variable in Railway dashboard:
1. Go to **Variables** tab
2. Add the variable
3. Railway will auto-redeploy

### Problem: "Cannot connect to Railway URL"

**Solution**: Check deployment status:
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Make sure latest deployment shows "Success"
3. Check logs for errors

### Problem: Twilio webhook returns 500 error

**Solution**: Check Railway logs:
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. View logs
3. Look for error messages
4. Common issues:
   - Missing API keys
   - Supabase connection error
   - Claude API rate limit

### Problem: "Out of memory" error

**Solution**: Increase RAM:
1. Go to **Settings** tab
2. Scroll to **"Resources"**
3. Increase memory allocation (default 512MB should be enough)

## Security Best Practices

‚úÖ **Do's:**
- Keep environment variables in Railway dashboard (never in code)
- Use HTTPS URLs only (Railway provides this automatically)
- Enable call recording consent
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity

‚ùå **Don'ts:**
- Don't commit `.env` file to GitHub (already in `.gitignore`)
- Don't share your Railway dashboard access
- Don't hardcode API keys in code

---

## Scaling Your Call Center

As your call center grows, Railway scales automatically:

**Small (0-100 calls/day)**
- Current setup is perfect
- ~$5-10/month

**Medium (100-500 calls/day)**
- No code changes needed
- Railway scales automatically
- ~$20-40/month

**Large (500+ calls/day)**
- Consider adding Redis for call state (optional)
- Increase Railway resources
- ~$50-100/month
