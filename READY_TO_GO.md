## 📝 Final Setup Steps

### Step 1: Run Supabase Setup (5 minutes)

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ajdehycoypilsegmxbto/sql/new
2. Copy the **entire contents** of `supabase-setup-safe.sql`
3. Paste into SQL Editor
4. Click **"RUN"**
5. Verify you see: "Call center products table created" with count: 5

✅ This creates separate tables that WON'T affect your quoting system's `products` table.

---

### Step 2: Install Dependencies (2 minutes)

```bash
npm install
```

This installs the new `@supabase/supabase-js` package.

---

### Step 3: Generate Product Embeddings (2 minutes)

```bash
node scripts/generate-embeddings.js
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Found 5 products

Processing: Sony 55" 4K Smart TV... ✅
Processing: Samsung 65" QLED TV... ✅
Processing: Apple iPhone 15 Pro... ✅
Processing: Dell XPS 13 Laptop... ✅
Processing: Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones... ✅

📊 Summary:
   ✅ Generated: 5
```

---

### Step 4: Test Your Services (2 minutes)

```bash
node scripts/test-services.js
```

This will test:
- ✅ Configuration validity
- ✅ ElevenLabs TTS (South African voice)
- ✅ Claude LLM
- ✅ Product search

---

### Step 5: Start the Server (1 minute)

```bash
npm start
```

**You should see:**
```
================================================
  Audico Call System - AI Voice Agent
================================================
  Server running on port: 3000

  Services:
    - STT: OpenAI Whisper
    - TTS: ElevenLabs (Voice ID: xeBpkkuzgxa0IwKt7NTP)
    - LLM: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

  Ready to accept calls!
================================================
```

---

### Step 6: Expose with Ngrok (2 minutes)

**In a NEW terminal window:**

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`)

---

### Step 7: Configure Twilio Webhooks (3 minutes)

1. Go to https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/incoming
2. Click your phone number: **+1 620 529 1708**
3. Scroll to **Voice Configuration**
4. Set:
   - **A call comes in**:
     - Webhook: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/voice/incoming`
     - HTTP POST
   - **Call Status Changes**:
     - Webhook: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/voice/status`
     - HTTP POST
5. Click **Save**

---

### Step 8: Test Your First Call! 🎉

**Call your Twilio number:** `+1 620 529 1708`

**What should happen:**
1. 🔊 Hear consent message (POPIA compliance)
2. 🗣️ Hear greeting in South African voice
3. 💬 Say: "Tell me about your Sony TV"
4. 🤖 AI responds with accurate product info from Supabase!

**Example conversation:**

> **You**: "Howzit, do you have a Sony 55-inch TV?"
>
> **AI** (with SA voice): "Ja, we have the Sony 55-inch 4K Smart TV available for R12,999. It's a lekker TV with 4K Ultra HD, HDR support, and built-in Android TV. We have 15 units in stock. Would you like to know more about it?"

---

## 🧪 Test Queries

Try asking your AI agent:

1. **"Tell me about your Sony TV"**
2. **"Do you have the iPhone 15?"**
3. **"What headphones are available?"**
4. **"Is the Samsung 65-inch QLED in stock?"**
5. **"Show me laptops"**

The AI should search Supabase and respond with accurate details!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Your Quoting System is Safe! ✅

The call center uses **separate tables**:
- `call_center_products` (for AI agent)
- Your `products` table (for quoting) is **untouched**

### Ngrok Session

Remember: Ngrok URLs change each time you restart it. Update Twilio webhooks each time.

For production, deploy to Heroku/AWS/Azure with a permanent URL.

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Missing required environment variables"
- All keys are configured in `.env` ✅

### "No products found"
- Run `supabase-setup-safe.sql` first
- Then run `node scripts/generate-embeddings.js`

### "Call not connecting"
- Check ngrok is running
- Verify Twilio webhooks are configured with ngrok URL
- Ensure server is running (`npm start`)

### "No audio on calls"
- ElevenLabs Voice ID is configured ✅
- Check ElevenLabs API key is valid
- Test with `node scripts/test-services.js`
