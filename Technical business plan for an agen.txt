Technical business plan for an agentic call‑centre agent with South‑African voice and multi‑option IVR
1 Overview and goals

Kenny’s objective is to offer customers a single telephone number in South Africa that is answered by an AI agent with a believable South‑African voice. The agent must greet callers, identify the reason for the call (sales, shipping, support, accounts, etc.), and then either complete the request autonomously or transfer the caller to the appropriate sub‑agent or human agent. It must capture caller details, update the CRM and log, and send a human‑readable summary to human agents (HITL) for edge cases. This plan surveys commercial and open‑source tools and proposes a high‑level architecture to build the solution immediately.

2 Requirements and considerations
Requirement	Implications
Local telephone numbers	The solution must provide a South‑African phone number (e.g., geographic numbers such as 021/011, national 087 numbers or toll‑free 0800). Providers like Voiso offer local, national, mobile and toll‑free numbers and note that local numbers help establish local presence

. Twilio also supports inbound and outbound calls within South Africa and provides SIP trunking and BYOC (bring‑your‑own‑carrier) support
twilio.com
.
Human‑like South‑African voice	To build customer trust, the agent should speak with a South‑African accent. Local TTS platforms such as Narakeet provide neural South‑African voices (Aletta, Piet, Charlize, etc.) designed to sound natural and cost‑effective
narakeet.com
narakeet.com
. Qfrency offers high‑quality South‑African voices supporting multiple languages; benefits include improved customer understanding and satisfaction
inclusivesolutions.co.za
. When building custom voices, ElevenLabs’ African‑accent TTS allows tone and emotional control and includes natural pauses and contextual awareness
elevenlabs.io
.
Flexible IVR and routing	The platform must route calls based on caller intent. Twilio Flex’s Studio tool lets businesses create drag‑and‑drop IVR flows for call forwarding, auto‑responders and WhatsApp menus

. Genesys Cloud AI offers predictive routing that automatically matches customers with the best agent based on target KPIs
genesys.com
. Google CCAI uses Dialogflow to build visual IVR with automated call distribution and AI‑based routing
getvoip.com
.
Advanced voice agent	Modern voice platforms should support large‑language‑model integration, tool calling, knowledge‑base look‑ups, multi‑lingual support and real‑time transcription. Vapi.ai’s API‑native voice platform allows developers to bring their own transcription, LLM and TTS models, supports multilingual conversations in 100+ languages, exposes everything via API, provides automated testing, tool‑calling, A/B experiments and 99.99 % uptime
vapi.ai
. The open‑source Pipecat framework connects to multiple STT providers, LLMs (Anthropic, OpenAI, Mistral etc.), TTS providers (ElevenLabs, AWS, Azure, PlayHT, etc.) and telephony serialisers (Twilio, Plivo, Telnyx). It includes a CLI, debugging tools and support for structured conversation flows
github.com
.
Omnichannel and agent assist	Because customers may transition between voice, WhatsApp/SMS, email and chat, the platform should be omnichannel. Twilio Flex offers a unified interface for voice, SMS, WhatsApp, chat and social channels
business.com
. Google CCAI integrates voice, SMS and chat channels and includes an Agent Assist module with live transcription, knowledge assist, smart reply and post‑call summarisation
getvoip.com
. Amazon Connect’s generative‑AI update adds agent coaching, generative summaries, generative segmentation and analytics to identify training needs
cxtoday.com
.
Integration with existing systems	The agent must update the existing CRM (e.g., Salesforce, Zoho, HubSpot) and perform actions such as creating orders, updating shipment statuses and collecting payments. Voiso integrates with major CRMs and emphasises improved answer rates for outbound calls via local caller ID, call‑statistics dashboards and remote work support
voiso.com
. Vapi.ai lists built‑in connectors for OpenAI, Anthropic, ElevenLabs, Deepgram, Google Calendar, Salesforce, HubSpot, Genesys and Avaya
vapi.ai
. Pipecat offers connectors to OpenTelemetry and Sentry for analytics
github.com
.
Compliance and data privacy (POPIA)	South African law requires organisations to process personal information lawfully and transparently. Consent to record calls must be obtained and stored; direct marketing requires explicit opt‑in and recording of the consent; data subjects have the right to access, correct and request deletion of their data, and calls must be stored securely with proper retention policies. Compliance frameworks (CallCabinet POPIA‑compliant recording, for example) encrypt calls and provide audit trails. Implement role‑based access control, retention policies and data subject request workflows.

Enterprise‑grade with built‑in AI: Genesys or Google CCAI. Use if reliability and predictive routing matter and budgets allow subscription/licensing fees.

AWS‑first strategy: Amazon Connect, especially if the business already uses AWS services; generative AI features can provide advanced analytics.

Quick start with local support: Voiso or CenturionAI. They offer local numbers, quick onboarding and pre‑built voice agents tailored to South Africa with multi‑language support
centurionai.co.za
.

6 Proposed architecture

Below is a recommended architecture for building a call‑centre agent that uses an AI voice for initial engagement and routes callers to sub‑agents or human agents. The architecture is modular to allow substitution of platforms.

Telephony layer: Choose a telephony provider (Twilio, Voiso or Telnyx) to secure local/national/toll‑free numbers. Configure SIP trunking or API integration to route inbound calls to the IVR/voice platform.

IVR and call orchestration layer: Use a contact centre platform such as Twilio Flex, Genesys or Google CCAI. Create a multi‑option IVR flow: greeting → menu (sales, shipping, support, accounts) → capture customer input via DTMF or speech. Use built‑in call flows or drag‑and‑drop builders to route calls. Connect to multi‑channel channels (WhatsApp, SMS, chat) if needed.

AI voice agent layer: Integrate Vapi.ai or Pipecat to handle the conversation once the caller selects an option. The agent uses:

Speech‑to‑text (STT): Choose a provider (e.g., Google Speech‑to‑Text, AssemblyAI, Deepgram). Pipecat can switch among providers
github.com
. Vapi allows bringing your own transcription model
vapi.ai
.

LLM: Use GPT‑4‑turbo or Claude for natural language understanding; optionally fine‑tune for domain‑specific knowledge and integrate with retrieval‑augmented generation to query CRM or knowledge base.

Tools: Use tool‑calling to fetch order status, log tickets or schedule call‑backs via API
vapi.ai
. Connect to CRM (Salesforce/Zoho/HubSpot) to update records.

TTS: Use South‑African voices (Narakeet, Qfrency, ElevenLabs) to respond to callers. Provide fallback to synthesised voices if unavailable.

Call routing and escalation: After the AI agent collects information and performs actions, decide whether the call is resolved or should be transferred:

Sales: If the AI qualifies a lead, transfer to a human sales agent; optionally schedule call‑back via CRM.

Shipping: Provide tracking status; if there is an exception, transfer to logistics agent.

Support: Attempt troubleshooting; if unresolved, create a ticket and route to support desk.

Accounts: Provide invoice details; if the customer wishes to pay, send a payment link via SMS/WhatsApp; if account issue persists, transfer to accounts agent.

Human agent and supervisor layer: Connect to existing contact centre system (e.g., Genesys or Twilio Flex). Agents receive calls in softphones or physical phones. Use Agent Assist features (transcription, knowledge suggestions, generative summary). Supervisors monitor queues, agent performance and call statistics
business.com
.

Analytics and quality assurance: Record calls (with consent). Use analytics platforms (Twilio Voice Insights, AWS Contact Lens, Genesys Insights) to monitor sentiment, containment rate and first‑contact resolution. Use A/B testing (available in Vapi) to experiment with prompts and voices
vapi.ai
. Store data securely and comply with POPIA requirements.

Compliance and security: Ensure calls are recorded only with consent; inform callers of recording at start. Encrypt recordings and transcripts; store them for the legally required period. Maintain role‑based access to recordings and data. Provide data subject request mechanisms. Implement DNC (do‑not‑call) lists and adhere to Section 69 of POPIA (direct marketing) requiring explicit consent. Use AI guardrails to avoid sensitive topics and filter out sensitive information (e.g., Amazon Connect guardrails
cxtoday.com
).

7 Implementation roadmap

Discovery and requirements (1 week): Identify call volumes, language requirements, CRM integrations, compliance policies and budget. Decide whether to build fully custom (Vapi/Pipecat + CPaaS) or adopt an integrated CCaaS (Genesys/Amazon Connect). Evaluate telephony providers based on number availability and cost.

Select vendors and sign up (1 week): Acquire South‑African numbers from Twilio or Voiso. Subscribe to TTS provider (Narakeet/Qfrency/ElevenLabs) and choose STT and LLM providers. Subscribe to chosen contact centre platform.

Design IVR and conversation flows (1–2 weeks): Using Twilio Studio, Genesys AI Studio or Dialogflow, design call flows. Implement conversation scripts in Vapi/Pipecat with prompt engineering and integrate tool‑calling to CRM and back‑end systems. Use multilingual support for Afrikaans or Zulu if needed.

Development and integration (2–4 weeks): Develop the AI agent back‑end and integrate with telephony and contact centre. Test TTS voices and adjust pronunciation. Implement CRM integration and create dashboards for supervisors. Conduct security and compliance review.

Testing (1 week): Use automated testing (available in Vapi
vapi.ai
) and Beta test with internal staff. Collect call samples, check voice naturalness and adjust prompts. Validate call transfers and ensure sub‑agent routing works.

Training and deployment (1 week): Train human agents on using the dashboards and handling AI‑escalated calls. Deploy gradually, starting with a single call queue. Monitor performance and iterate. CenturionAI notes that a complete AI voice agent implementation can be delivered in 7–14 days
centurionai.co.za
; our timeline may be longer due to custom development.

Continuous improvement: Use analytics and A/B testing to improve prompts, voices and flows. Monitor legal changes (e.g., POPIA amendments) and update consent messages accordingly.

8 Summary

By combining a reliable telephony provider (Twilio or Voiso), a flexible contact centre platform (Twilio Flex, Genesys, Google CCAI or Amazon Connect) and a voice‑agent framework (Vapi.ai or Pipecat) with locally‑authentic TTS voices, Kenny can deploy a sophisticated agentic call‑centre solution. The AI agent will greet callers with a South‑African accent, collect information, perform transactions via tool‑calling, and either resolve issues autonomously or transfer callers to specialised sub‑agents. Integrating analytics, agent assist and compliance controls ensures the system meets business needs while adhering to South African regulations.
